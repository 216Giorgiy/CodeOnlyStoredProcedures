        <description>A library for easily calling Stored Procedures in .NET. Works great with Entity Framework Code First models. 
Code Only Stored Procedures will not create any Stored Procedures on your database. Instead, its aim is to make it easy to call your existing stored procedures by writing simple code.</description>
        <releaseNotes>2.0.0
Removed dependency on SQL Server for all stored procedures (except those that accept Table Valued Parameters)
Performance improvements
Results from the dynamic syntax can now be cast explicitly
Stored Procedures that return hierarchical objects as multiple result sets can now have their relationships automatically discovered

1.3.1
Fixed bug where none of the named properties of StoredProcedureParameterAttribute could be set on an object, because they were nullable.
Fixed bug where calling a stored procedure that returns results asynchronously could block the calling thread.

1.3.0
Added StoredProcedure.Execute and StoredProcedure.ExecuteAsync methods to more explicitly control dynamic stored procedures.
Added ability to specify an implementation of an interface, so a StoredProcedure can return an IEnumerable&lt;interface&gt;

1.2.1
Added better exception when a model is missing a public parameterless constructor.

1.2.0
Added a much cleaner syntax for calling stored procedures, by using dynamic objects.

1.1.0
Improved exceptions so that it is easier to determine why the data returned doesn't map to your model correctly.
Now ignores read-only properties, so they don't have to be attributed with [NotMapped]

1.0.1
Fixed bug where calling a stored procedure within a Task that was executing on the SynchronizationContext could cause a deadlock.

1.0.0
Added implementation of ToString that will print the stored procedure's schema, name, and parameters.
Significantly improved speed of the code that converts values to enum values.
Added xml comments to all public methods. While not complete documentation, they are a huge first step.</releaseNotes>
