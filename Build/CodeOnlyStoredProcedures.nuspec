        <description>A library for easily calling Stored Procedures in .NET. Works great with Entity Framework Code First models. 
Code Only Stored Procedures will not create any Stored Procedures on your database. Instead, its aim is to make it easy to call your existing stored procedures by writing simple code.</description>
        <releaseNotes>1.0.0
Added implementation of ToString that will print the stored procedure's schema, name, and parameters.
Significantly improved speed of the code that converts values to enum values.
Added xml comments to all public methods. While not complete documentation, they are a huge first step.

0.6.0
Significantly reduced reflection usage. Now, reflection happens once per result type, and is compiled into a lambda expression. This should help improve performance significantly.
          
0.5.0
Added support for single column result sets without creating a result model. For instance, if your stored procedure returns one string column, you can retrieve the values with a StoredProcedure&lt;string&gt;        

0.4.0
Updated execution logic so the CPU won't spike while running, but commands can still be cancelled.

0.3.0
Added data transformation attribute &amp; IDataTransformer for interning strings.
Added IDataTransformer implementation for trimming strings.

0.2.0
Added data transformation attribute for converting numeric types automatically from their database type to the property type the attribute decorates.
Added data transformation attribute to automatically remove whitespace from strings returned from the database.

0.1.0
Created continuous deployment server.
Added symbols to symbolsource.org
Updated to check code contracts at runtime.

0.0.7
Added support for altering the results from the database to make data models simpler.
Added code contracts to all methods.
          
0.0.6
Added support for DBNull values.
Bug fixes.

0.0.5
Added support for .NET 4.0 (with a dependency on EF).
Fixed critical bugs with (now removed) release 0.0.4</releaseNotes>
